### This Bot was developed using Discord API in python (discord.py)

The bot responds to commands given by the users. Currently it has limited set of commands to respond to, but we can easily add more.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è How to setup

1. Login/Signup on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new Application.
2. [Setup a bot Application](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)
3. [Add the bot to a Server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html)
4. Copy/Paste the BOT_TOKEN in a `.env` file.
5. Then Copy & Paste the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/gulraiznoorbari/Discord_Chat_Bot_Python.git
cd Discord_Chat_Bot_Python
python bot.py
```
### OPTIONAL: The bot can be hosted on [DisCloud](https://discloudbot.com/en_US) (cloud hosting for Discord Bots) so it doesn't stop when you close the terminal.

## Future Work:

- [x] Add Slash Commands (using [nextcord](https://docs.nextcord.dev/en/stable/interactions.html) or [discord-py-slash-command](https://discord-interactions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#now-let-s-create-our-first-slash-command))
- [x] API Integration
